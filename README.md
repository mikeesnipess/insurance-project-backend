Here you can see the backend part of the project that I am continuously developing to achieve the project's goal, specifically Occupational Insurance. This project aims to provide a much easier way to obtain this type of insurance online.

The backend is built using a combination of modern technologies and frameworks to ensure reliability, scalability, and security. Some key features and technologies used include:

.NET Core:

The core of the backend is built on .NET Core, which provides a robust and high-performance framework for developing web APIs.
It allows for cross-platform development, meaning the application can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Entity Framework Core:

For data access and management, we use Entity Framework Core, which simplifies the interaction with the database through an object-relational mapper (ORM).
It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, and schema migrations, making it easier to handle database operations.

MSSQL:(coming soon)

The application uses Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) as the primary database. MSSQL offers advanced features for data storage, retrieval, and security.
It ensures data integrity and provides high availability and disaster recovery options.
Authentication and Authorization:

The backend implements robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure API endpoints.
This ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access certain features of the application.

Integration with External Services:(DocuSign not finished, Stripe, FMCSA)

The project integrates with various external services such as DocuSign for electronic signatures and Stripe for payment processing.
These integrations streamline the insurance process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

API Design:

The backend API is designed following RESTful principles, ensuring a clean and intuitive interface for client applications.
It includes endpoints for managing user data, processing insurance policies, handling payments, and more.

Testing and Quality Assurance:(coming soon)

Comprehensive unit tests and integration tests are written to ensure the reliability and stability of the backend code.
Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up to automate testing and deployment processes.

Documentation:(coming soon)

Detailed API documentation is provided using Swagger/OpenAPI, allowing developers to easily understand and interact with the API.
This documentation is essential for both internal development and third-party integrations.

In summary, the backend of the Occupational Insurance project is a well-architected system designed to make obtaining occupational insurance online seamless and efficient. As I continue to develop and enhance the backend, I focus on maintaining high standards of code quality, security, and performance.
